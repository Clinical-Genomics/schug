HGNC is promise that each gene have a unique gene identifier in the form if a HGNC ID, Schug also use this as the primary identifier of a gene since symbols tend to vary over time. HGNC does also provide a stable gene symbol for each gene. Gene coordinates HGNC do not provide a mapping from gene id to coordinates so schug use Ensembl as the resource for location of genes. Mapping from Ensembl Gene ID (ENSG) to HGNC ID is done by Ensembl. Genes to transcripts Genes are linked to transcripts in Ensembl, Shoug only consider ensembl transcripts Transcripts and exons Transcript and exon definitions are taken from Ensembl only, also the linking between transcripts and exons are done by ensembl.
